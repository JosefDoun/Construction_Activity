The current project constitutes ancillary work for my thesis "Land Cover Analysis using OBIA: Municipalities of Delta, Chalkidona, Oraiokastro".

It examines the long-term distribution of construction permits within a study area in north Greece, for the purpose of identifying construction interest trends. The trends were then used with geospatial and demographic data, in order to assist with regional planning decisions.
